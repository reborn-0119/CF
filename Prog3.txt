Objective:
Load the live NTUSER.DAT hive and extract proof-of-execution evidence from the UserAssist key
using Registry Explorer (superior to regedit ).

Tools Required:
Windows OS
RegistryExplorer.exe (EZ Tools)
Recent program activity (run 2–3 apps before starting)

Procedure
1. Download Registry Explorer
    Same site: https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md
    Extract → place RegistryExplorer.exe in C:\EZ_Tools\
2. Launch & Load Live Hive
    Run RegistryExplorer.exe as Administrator
    File → Load Live Hive
    Select NTUSER.DAT (current user)
3. Navigate to UserAssist
    Use Bookmarks panel → expand NTUSER.DAT
    Go to:
    Software → Microsoft → Windows → CurrentVersion → Explorer →UserAssist
4. Extract Evidence
    Click any {GUID}\Count subkey
    In the right pane, view decoded ROT13 entries
    Record the last 3 executed programs:
        Full path
        Run count
        Last run timestamp (converted)
5. Forensic Analysis
    Why Registry Explorer > regedit?
     Auto-decodes ROT13
     Shows timestamps & run counts
     Bookmark navigation
    UserAssist Significance:
     Tracks GUI program launches
     Persists after deletion of shortcuts/history

Deliverable Table (Example)
#,  Program Name (Decoded),      Full Path,                   Run Count,      Last Execution (UTC)
1,  Chrome.exe,             C:\Program Files\Google\
                            Chrome\Application\chrome.exe,    152,            2025-11-20 14:30:05
2,  Notepad.exe,            C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe,  5,              2025-11-26 09:15:00
3,  Calculator.exe,         C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe,     12,             2025-11-26 10:00:22

Conclusion:
The UserAssist key provides reliable, persistent proof of program execution, surviving cleanup
attempts. Registry Explorer is the forensic standard for parsing this data efficiently and accurately.
