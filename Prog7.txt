Use the I/O Graph to visualize network traff
Goal:
Use a graph to see exactly when a burst of heavy internet traffic happened and what caused it1.
The 6 Simple Steps:
1. Quiet Start:
    Start a Wireshark capture and wait a moment for the lines to be flat/stable
2. Make Noise:
    Suddenly do something heavy—like starting a 4K YouTube video or
    downloading a large file—to create a "spike"
3. Stop & Graph:
    Stop the capture. Go to menu Statistics -> I/O Graph
4. Find the Bump:
    Look for the big mountain on the graph.
    Hover your mouse over the peak to find the exact Time (e.g., 45 seconds in)
5. Filter Time:
    Close the graph. In the main filter bar, type frame.time_relative >= [Time] (replace [Time] with the number you found)
6. Identify Culprit:
    Go to Statistics -> Protocol Hierarchy to see which protocol
    (like "Data" or "TLS") is taking up all the space during that time.

Deliverable (Example)
1. The Graph Observation
    Traffic Spike Time: 00:00:45 (45 seconds into capture).
    Activity: I started downloading a 1GB file at this moment.
2. The Protocol Analysis
Top Protocol During Spike,      % Bytes,    Explanation
TLS (Transport Layer Security), 98.2%,      This is the encrypted video stream/download data coming from the server.

Why is this useful?
It helps network administrators find out why the internet suddenly got slow at a
specific time (e.g., someone started a huge backup or watched Netflix during work hours).
