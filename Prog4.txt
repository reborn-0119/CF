Objective:
Capture the invisible data packets flying through the air to see exactly
what websites a user visited—even if they cleared their browser history.
Tools Required:
Windows/macOS/Linux
Wireshark (latest version: https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)
Internet connection
Web browser (to generate traffic)
Procedure
1. Install & Launch Wireshark
    Download and install Wireshark (include Npcap on Windows).
    Launch Wireshark as Administrator (required for capture).
2. Select Capture Interface
    In the main window, double-click the active network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi , Ethernet )
    with rising packet graph.
    Ensure Promiscuous Mode is enabled (default).
3. Start Capture & Generate Traffic
    Click Start (blue shark fin).
    Open browser → visit 3 different websites (e.g., http://du.ac.in ,
    http://neverssl.com , https://wikipedia.org ).
    Perform 1 DNS lookup: Open new tab → type test.local → press Enter.
    Stop capture after 30–60 seconds.
4. Filter HTTP Traffic
    In filter bar, type: http → press Enter.
    Look for GET requests in Info column.
    Right-click a GET packet → Follow → HTTP Stream.
    Record: Host header (visited domain).
5. Filter DNS Traffic
    Clear filter → type: dns → press Enter.
    Locate Standard query A for test.local .
    Expand DNS packet → record Queries → Name.
6. Export Evidence
    File → Export Objects → HTTP → Save any downloaded files (if applicable).
    File → Export Specified Packets → Save filtered DNS packets as dns_evidence.pcapng .
7. Timeline Reconstruction
    Sort by Time column.
    Document sequence: DNS query → TCP handshake → HTTP GET → Response.

Deliverable Tables
1. HTTP Artifacts (Visited Sites)
#,  HTTP Method,    Status Code,    Timestamp,  Domain (Host)
1,  GET,            200 OK,         10:45:01,   www.neverssl.com
2,  GET,            301 Moved,      10:45:05,   www.du.ac.in
3,  GET,            200 OK,         10:45:10,   www.wikipedia.org
2.DNS Query Evidence
Query Name,     Response,                 Query Type,         Packet #
test.local ,    No response / NXDOMAIN,   A (Standard Query), 452

Conclusion:
Wireshark transforms raw packets into actionable forensic intelligence. Even with HTTPS dominance,
DNS queries, HTTP sites, and metadata reveal user intent and behavior — critical in network intrusion
and insider threat cases.
