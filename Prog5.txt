Protocol Analysis (Traffic Breakdown)
Objective:
Find out which "languages" (protocols) your computer uses the most and which ones take up the most data.
Procedure:
1. Capture Normal Traffic
    Start Wireshark and do normal things (watch a video, browse) for 5 minutes.
    Stop the capture.
2. Open the Report
    Go to the menu: Statistics -> Protocol Hierarchy.
3. Compare the Numbers
    Look at the % Packets column (how often it speaks).
    Look at the % Bytes column (how heavy the data is).
Deliverable Tables
1. Top 3 Protocols by Packet Count (Frequency)
Rank,   Protocol Name,  % Packets
1,      TCP,            85.2%
2,      TLS (HTTPS),    60.1%
3,      DNS,            5.4%
2. Top 3 Protocols by Byte Count (Data Size)
Rank,   Protocol Name,  % Bytes
1,      TLS (HTTPS),    92.5%
2,      TCP,            95.0%
3,      QUIC,           2.1%

Analysis Question:
Why is there a difference?
Packets: Count how many "envelopes" are sent. Simple tasks like DNS send 
         many tiny envelopes (high packets, low bytes).
Bytes: Measure the "weight" of the envelopes. Video streaming sends fewer,
       but huge envelopes (lower packets, very high bytes).
