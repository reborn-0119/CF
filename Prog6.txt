Unique devices (endpoints) on the network and analyze the conversations
Objective: 
Find out exactly which computers are on the network and which two are talking the most.
Procedure
1. Start & Wait: 
   Start a Wireshark capture and use your computer normally for 5 minutes
2. Stop:
   Click the red square to stop the capture
3. Check Devices (Endpoints):
   Go to menu Statistics -> Endpoints and click the IPv4 tab
4. List Top Devices:
   Click the "Packets" column title to sort.
   Write down the top 5 IP addresses
5. Check Chats (Conversations):
   Go to menu Statistics -> Conversations and click the TCP tab
6. Find Top Chat:
   Find the line with the highest number of packets.
   Note the two IPs and the Port Number (like 443 or 80)7777.
Deliverable Tables
1. Top 5 Active Devices (Endpoints)
Rank,   IP Address,                 Packets Sent
1,      192.168.1.5 (My PC),        5,200
2,      172.217.160.142 (Google),   4,100
3,      192.168.1.1 (Router),       850
4,      157.240.16.35 (Facebook),   320
5,      104.16.132.229 (Cloudflare) 150
2. The "Loudest" Conversation
Address A (Source),    Address B (Dest),    Total Packets,  Port Used,  Service (Inferred)
192.168.1.5,           172.217.160.142,     3,500,          443,        HTTPS (Secure Web)

Analysis:
Port 443 = HTTPS (Secure Browsing) 
Port 80 = HTTP (Unsecured Web)
Port 53 = DNS (Looking up names)
