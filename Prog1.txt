Objective: 
To generate a cryptographic hash (specifically SHA-256) of a file 
and demonstrate that any modification—even a single bit—produces a 
completely different hash, proving data tampering.

Tools Required:
Windows OS 
Hasher.exe (from EZ Tools by Eric Zimmerman) 
Notepad (or any text editor)

Procedure
1. Setup the Tool
Download Hasher.zip from the Eric Zimmerman GitHub page.
Extract the zip file and place Hasher.exe in a folder (e.g., C:\EZ Tools\).
2. Create the "Evidence"
Open Notepad and type the exact sentence:
"Forensic evidence must never be altered."
Save this file as evidence_original.txt inside your tools folder.
3. Calculate the Baseline Hash
Open your Command Prompt (cmd) and navigate to your folder (cd C:\EZ Tools).
Run the following command to generate the SHA-256 hash: Hasher.exe -f evidence_original.txt --sha256
Action: Record the long string of characters it outputs. This is your Baseline Hash
4. Simulate Tampering
Open evidence_original.txt in Notepad again.
Change the word "never" to "always".
Save the file.
5. Calculate the Tampered Hash
Run the same command again: Hasher.exe -f evidence_original.txt --sha256
Action: Record this new hash string as the Tampered Hash.

Analysis & Results
When you compare the two hash values, you will notice they are completely different.
The Observation: Even though you only changed one word, the resulting 64-character hash is entirely different.

Conclusion: 
Cryptographic hashing ensures integrity verification. Any alteration invalidates the hash, 
providing tamper-evidence that is critical in legal proceedings.
