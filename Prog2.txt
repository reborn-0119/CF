Objective:
Use built-in CLI tools to gather network configuration, active connections, and trace packet paths.

Tools Required:
Command Prompt (Windows)
Internet connection

Procedure and Windows Command
1. Task: Record IP, MAC, Gateway, DNS
   Command: ipconfig /all
2. Task: Find an ESTABLISHED connection → note PID
   Command: netstat -ano
3. Task: Count hops, identify first hop (gateway)
   Command: tracert www.google.com

Deliverable: Network Recon Table
Item                            Value
IP Address 
MAC Address 
Default Gateway 
DNS Server
ESTABLISHED PID
Process Name (from PID)
Total Hops to Google
First Hop (Gateway IP)

Conclusion:
Built-in OS tools enable passive reconnaissance of network state and routing paths — essential
for incident response and forensic timeline reconstruction.
